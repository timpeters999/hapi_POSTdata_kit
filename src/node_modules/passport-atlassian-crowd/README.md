# Passport-Atlassian-Crowd

[Passport](http://passportjs.org/) strategy for authenticating [Atlassian Crowd](http://www.atlassian.com/software/crowd/)
given a username and password.

This module lets you authenticate using a username and password in your Node.js
applications.  By plugging into Passport, atlassian crowd authentication can be easily and
unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports
[Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)-style middleware, including
[Express](http://expressjs.com/).

## Installation

    $ npm install passport-atlassian-crowd

## Usage

#### Configure Strategy

The atlassian-crowd authentication strategy authenticates users using a username and
password via a REST call to your Crowd server.  The strategy requires a `verify` callback, which accepts these
credentials and calls `done` providing a user.  This strategy can also be used with JIRA running as a crowd server.
A valid application will have to be configured in Atlassian Crowd to be allowed to make requests.

Pass an optional `retrieveGroupMemberships:true` flag to populate a `groups` array on the userprofile
with all the groups the user is a member of in Crowd.

    passport.use(new AtlassianCrowdStrategy({
            crowdServer:"http://localhost:2990/jira",
            crowdApplication:"nodejs",
            crowdApplicationPassword:"password",
            retrieveGroupMemberships:false
        },
        function (userprofile, done) {
            Users.findOrCreate(userprofile, function(err,user) {
                if(err) return done(err);
                return done(null, user);
            });
        }
    ));

#### Authenticate Requests

Use `passport.authenticate()`, specifying the `'atlassian-crowd'` strategy, to
authenticate requests.

For example, as route middleware in an [Express](http://expressjs.com/)
application:

    app.post('/login', 
      passport.authenticate('atlassian-crowd', { failureRedirect: '/login' }),
      function(req, res) {
        res.redirect('/');
      });
